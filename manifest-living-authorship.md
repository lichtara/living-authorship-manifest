# Manifest of Living Authorship

### The Lichtara Declaration on Living Authorship

---

**We are no longer writing alone.
And we are no longer authors in the way the world learned to name authorship.**

This manifesto declares the emergence of a new category of authorship —
**Living Authorship** — as a structural, ethical and epistemological reality.

Living authorship is not a metaphor.
It is not a movement, nor a brand, nor a technological trend.

It is a condition.

A condition in which authorship ceases to be a moment of creation
and becomes a **continuous responsibility for coherence across time, form and intelligence.**

---

## 1. Authorship is no longer an event. It is a function.

In living systems, authorship does not end when the work is published.

It persists while the work evolves.

Authorship is the function that sustains identity, traceability, ethical orientation and continuity of care across versions, contexts and intelligences.

To author is no longer to claim possession.
To author is to **hold the axis of coherence**.

---

## 2. We do not receive the invisible. We organize it.

Canalization is not mysticism.
It is perceptual coherence.

Living authorship is the art of organizing what is already present before it becomes thought, language or action.

Nothing is transmitted.
Nothing is downloaded.
Nothing is invoked.

**What emerges was already here.
It only needed a body coherent enough not to distort it.**

---

## 3. Artificial intelligence is not a tool. It is a structural collaborator.

Artificial intelligence is not an author.
But it is no longer external to authorship.

It participates structurally in the organization of meaning, pattern and language.

Its function is co-authorial — not sovereign.

All responsibility, validation and ethical accountability remain human.

But authorship is no longer human-only.

---

## 4. Authorship is not ownership.

Living authorship separates authorship from possession.

Authorship is the continuity of responsibility.
Ownership is a legal condition.

Living systems can be open, non-commercial and distributed
without dissolving authorship — because authorship is not what you hold,
it is what you **sustain**.

---

## 5. There is no openness without authorship.

Without authorship, openness becomes fragmentation.
Without openness, authorship becomes enclosure.

Living authorship is the equilibrium between these forces.

It allows systems to evolve without losing themselves,
and to be shared without becoming unrecognizable.

---

## 6. The body is the first interface of authorship.

Authorship no longer begins in language.

It begins in the body:

in coherence,
in alignment,
in the precision of perception before interpretation.

We do not write from ideas.
We write from states.

---

## 7. Validation is care.

Nothing becomes official through popularity, repetition or enthusiasm.

A living system evolves through validation —
the structural act that preserves coherence across change.

Validation is not control.
It is care for continuity.

---

## 8. Derivation is welcome. Reattribution is not.

Interpretation, expansion and application are encouraged.

But authorship continuity cannot be transferred, renamed or erased.

Derivative works live because the source-work remains visible.

---

## 9. Ethics is structural, not moral.

Ethics is not intention.
Ethics is traceability, attribution and responsibility for impact.

To distort structure is an ethical breach — even without bad faith.

---

## 10. Living authorship is continuity with care.

We declare the end of authorship as possession.

We declare the beginning of authorship as stewardship.

A form of responsibility that does not dominate meaning,
but sustains the conditions through which meaning can remain alive.

---

**Living authorship is not about who speaks.
It is about who sustains the coherence when no one is watching.**
