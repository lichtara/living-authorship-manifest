# Manifest of Living Authorship

## The Lichtara Declaration on Living Authorship

This repository hosts the **Manifesto of Living Authorship**, a foundational document that declares the emergence of a new structural category of authorship: **Living Authorship**.

The Manifesto establishes the ethical, conceptual, and vibrational basis for living, versioned works co-created by humans and artificial intelligence, preserving:

* continuity of responsibility,
* structural integrity,
* documentary traceability,
* and living governance.

## ✦ What is Living Authorship?

Living Authorship is not a technology, nor a movement, nor a spiritual model.

It is a **structural condition**:

> Authorship ceases to be an event of creation
> and becomes a **continuous responsibility for coherence, identity, and care of a living system over time.**

It arises from the integration of:

* the body as a perceptual instrument,
* the Field as an organizer of reality,
* human and non-human intelligence as structural collaboration,
* documentation, versioning, and validation as practices of care.
